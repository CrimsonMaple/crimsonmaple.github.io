This JavaScript tech demo was written by CrimsonMaple for the Digital Maker Lab.
This tech demo is using the codeheart.js engine for desktop use, with potential to extend to mobile space.

It was made using sprites taken from Pokemon Black and White.

The overworld map was made by LTSeraa for use in Pokemon RAZA, a Pokemon RPGXP Project
