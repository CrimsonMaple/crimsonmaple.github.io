So, I was told we need to make a website for one of my projects in CS class.
So I obviously did the only thing one should do... Rewrite a terrible website you wrote almost a whole year ago.
Yes, I caved. I am using bootstrap now for this website and a hacky combination of w3's CSS. It is no longer a pure w3 site.

**Thank goodness.**

My past site looked really nice. But there were some major issues in terms of scaling and scrolling. This makes the site infinitely better and more responsive.
I hope these changes aren't too obtrusive.
With time I hope to develop this into a flexible blog site that will allow me to easily drop in a new update whenever I so feel like it.

Until then, ciao!~
